                    Currently working on core features to build out a new kind of loyalty membership

                    My responsibilities in this role revolve around building out features an maintaining
                    them throughout their lifecycle. This means I get to architect solutions, get
                    feedback from peers, as well as lead and develop these features. Given that the 
                    engineering team at Hang is quite Senior, I get to collaborate on projects that 
                    others are leading as well, and see new perspectives and processes that might be
                    more impactful than the ones I use, due to this, I am constantly evolving things
                    such as the way I write documentation, lead projects, and tooling.

                    In terms of tech stack, the backend team is currently using Ruby on Rails 
                    (sometimes Ruby on Roda) as its main language. While my experience was nonexistent
                    before joining the team, I find that it is a fast language to pick up and allows our
                    team to move at a blindingly fast pace. As for other technologies, we tend to stick
                    with tooling that integrates well with ruby on rails with minimal friction, meaning 
                    there exists APIs, libraries, SDKs, or CLIs that we can easily call within code.

                    During my time at Plaid, I was on the data integrations team, more specifically the Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions team (LIT). We were responsible for the aggregation of data around the named three product verticals, as well as a couple other product areas critical to internal operations. I was lucky enough to be the product owner from the Engineering team for the Liabilities product, which focused mostly on credit cards, home mortgages, and student loans.

                  <p>
                    My responsibilities in this role revolved around building out connections to financial institutions that were deemed high yield for Plaid to have a relationship with (moreso focused on institutions with liabilities data), as well as maintaining data quality for our existing institution support. Generally speaking a lot of these decisions were data driven, therefore we would spend a few days at the end of quarter to analyze ways we could impact our product verticals the most across the next 1-2 quarters.

                    Our tech stack was mostly focused on Typescript and Python. A lot of internal tooling had been built out for our team to securely access and analyze data, which allowed for us to directly fix customer issues at scale.

                    During my time at Pax8, I was a backend engineer on the Ordering team. This involved a lot of work around building out a good customer experience in our product catalog page, as well as building and refining the promotions experience that many cloud vendors offered. My time here involved a lot of development on updating and fixing the promotions product (i.e. updating queries, fixing invoicing with promotions, as well as refactoring a lot of code around it to decouple the service).

                    In terms of tech stack, the backend team used JVM based languages, initially heavy on Groovy, then transitioning to being more Kotlin heavy. A lot of our tech around Databases was with relational databases (Postgres), as well as using Elasticsearch to build indices for faster access.

                    My contributions to this team were to help with integrating the existing Main Street Hub Reputation management tool with GoDaddy. This included work to sign up users on the Main Street Hub website and persist them into GoDaddy's systems, as well as migrating all users over to GoDaddy. I also contributed to a lot of work around building out internal tools to help the social media teams, as well helped build out forms to allow specific user requests after onboarding with GoDaddy Social.

                  <p>
                    The tech stack I worked with was mostly JVM based and Javascript/ Typescript
                    (React). A lot of the work was building out microservices in Java, Kotlin, and touching on Scala when overlapping work with the Data engineering based teams. Given the legacy application for Main Street Hub was written in PHP, I had some exposure to that as well.

                  <p>
                    During my time at General Motors, I worked in the data quality organization. My team was responsible for helping manage the data around manufacturing, meaning a lot of the information that came up around defects the manufacturing process, they would be recorded in FMEA files (Failure Modes Effects Analysis).

                  </br>
                  <p>
                    The majority of my work was centered around migrating all the data in our existing FMEA host into a different one. Given the existing FMEA system did not have a way for our team to mass export data, the only option was to extract each FMEA file as CSV, similar to how an individual user would export data. The data then had to be interpreted and trasformed such that it could be written into the new system.

                  </br>
                  <p>
                    The tech stack for this role was very interesting. We had a lot of freedom to choose what we wanted to use because there was no precedent set, and all we really needed was a black box solution. Since exporting the data was the first issue we had to solve, we had to write a bot using java and a selenium driver to take all the actions of the user would to export data. This data then had to be saved into a server file storage, then read into, transformed, and written into the new system, which the entry point into that system was via API. This component was written in python due to the existing libraries and ease of use.

                    During my time at Intel as an intern, I assisted the product analyst team at the mobile computing site in Austin, Texas. The project analyst team focused mostly on providing helpful information on the status of projects.

                    My responsibilities in this role were mostly to build out tools to help the project analyst team be a bit more efficient. A lot of the work involved writing data parsing scripts to pull required information, as well as organizing the data itself into a more digestible format. Minor responsibilities also included building out reports in excel, as well as creating a website to aggregate report data for centralized viewing.

                  <p>
                    The tech stack in this role varied depending on the task and who the work was for. Most data parsing scripts were written in Perl due to the strong syntax of string parsing and precedence set in the company using that language. Many scripts that worked directly with Excel sheets were either writtin in Python or VBA, if the script had to be run by project analysts, often times VBA was the choice. Other technologies I used were AngularJS to aggregate data reports into a central viewing space.
